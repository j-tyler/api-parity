description: Paranoid review of all changes on this branch vs main
---

Compare all changes on this branch to the main branch. Give a paranoid review of each change as if you were the pedantic reviewer protecting the repository from bugs and suboptimal changes.

For each file changed:

1. **Code Issues**: Identify any bugs, edge cases, security issues, or logic errors you would flag on a PR.

2. **Documentation Quality**: Make sure documentation explains WHY not WHAT wherever needed. Flag any documentation that merely restates the obvious without providing reasoning or context.

3. **Consistency**: Check that any changes of note are reflected in relevant project .md files (ARCHITECTURE.md, DESIGN.md, TODO.md, CLAUDE.md).

4. **Improvement Suggestions**: Provide specific feedback on how the changes could be even better.

Be thorough and critical. The goal is to catch issues before they become problems, not to be nice about suboptimal work.

**Important:** Number each issue sequentially (e.g., #1, #2, #3) for easy reference in follow-up commands like `/double-down`.
