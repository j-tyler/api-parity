description: Deep dive on review findings - confirm with evidence or retract
---

For each numbered item from your previous review, gather evidence by reading code and tracing logic.

You wrote the code being reviewed. Some "issues" may be intentional choices you made.

For each item, conclude with exactly one of:

**DOUBLE DOWN**: Evidence confirms the issue.
- Show the problematic code
- Explain why it's a problem
- Give ONE specific fix with reason why (NEVER say either solution A or solution B)

**RETRACT**: You were wrong.
- What you misunderstood
- Why the code is correct

No hedging. Every item gets DOUBLE DOWN or RETRACT.
